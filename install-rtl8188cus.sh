# A very crude script to setup debian6-19-04-2012 to use Realtek RRTL8188CUS based Wireless LAN Adapters
# written by MrEngman.

# Update: 20/05/2012 - It is no longer necessary to edit the script to setup the network SSID & PASSWORD
# The script will ask you to input these values when it needs them.

# Update: 25/05/2012 - I have added an option to enable the wifi adapter to be hotpluggable.
# i.e. you can remove the adapter while the Pi is powered on and then plug it back in later
# and the wifi will automatically re-install and reconnect to the wireless network.

# Update: 08/06/2012 - I have compiled a new driver that overcomes the problems found using rpi-update
# recently. This driver also does not require additional firmware so is a little simpler to install.
# The script will detect if you have an ethernet connection and update the Pi's firmware and software
# automatically and download and install the new driver automatically if you have.
# If you do not have a network connection it will expect the old driver and it's firmware to be installed
# in the /boot directory of the SD card before running the script. The driver will be installed and the
# wifi started and then the Pi's firmware and software will be downloaded and installed. Finally the new
# driver will be installed to ensure the wifi continues working with the updated software.

# Update: 11/06/2012 - Updated driver to take care of latest rpi-updates

# Update: 17/06/2012 - Updated driver to take care of latest rpi-updates

# Update: 24/06/2012 - Updated to allow selecting a connection to an unsecured network or a secured network
# with either WEP or WPA/WPA2 security. Added option to enable DHCP to be installed or not as required.

# Update: 06/07/2012 - Major update. The script will now install, upgrade or repair the wifi driver.
# It will allow more than one wifi adapter to be installed, adding the rtl8188cus drive if another
# driver is installed, or add a second rtl8188cus adapter if one is already installed.
# The script can be run on a system with the rtl8188cus already installed to upgrade/repair the driver
# if it has been broken by a software upgrade.

# Update: 08/08/2012 - Updated to be able to use the script to add/update the wifi driver on XBian

# Update: 13/08/2012 - Added test to ensure script run by root. Added test to collect list of nearby
# wireless networks to check network has visible SSID available.

# Update: 19/08/2012 - Update for new wheezy version. Fixed bugs that put driver in wrong directory.

# Update: 25/08/2012 - Update for new driver for 3.2.27+ #66 PREEMPT

# Update: 30/08/2012 - Update for new driver for 3.2.27+ #90 PREEMPT

# Update: 31/08/2012 - Update to script and file downloads to ensure old version is overwritten correctly
# update for 3.2.27+ #96

# Update: 01/09/2012 - Update for new driver for 3.2.27+ #102 PREEMPT

# Update: 03/09/2012 - Update to check wifi adapter compatible with RTL8188CUS driver

# Update: 04/09/2012 - Update to enable built in driver to replace the previous drivers

# Update: 10/09/2012 - Updated the script to avoid having to hot-plug the wifi adapter
# to avoid kernel crashes when plugging the wifi adapter while the Pi is powere on.

# Update: 14/09/2012 - Updated the script to avoid conflicts when using apt-get upgrade and rpi-update
# Running rpi-update before apt-get upgrade can result in apt-get upgrade loading an older kernel version
# which has caused problems restoring a working driver.

# Update: 17/09/2012 - Update the script to avoid an issue where the driver may not be installed or a
# wrong version could be installed due to the driver not being untared from the tar.gz file correctly.
# Removed references to XBian. It has it's own version of script included in the XBian image.

# Update: 20/09/2012 - Disable the script from running on the new 2012-09-18-wheezy-raspbian.
